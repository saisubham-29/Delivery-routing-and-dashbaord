# Delivery Routing and Dashboard

## Overview

Delivery Routing and Dashboard is a web-based solution designed to optimize delivery operations for logistics and e-commerce businesses. The project enables efficient planning, visualization, and tracking of delivery routes, providing real-time insights via an interactive dashboard. The goal is to minimize delivery times, reduce operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Route Optimization:** Calculates the most efficient delivery routes based on address data and constraints (e.g., time windows, vehicle capacity).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes delivery status, route maps, KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and driver performance.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitors delivery progress using GPS data and updates the dashboard accordingly.
- **Order Management:** Allows users to add, edit, and track delivery orders.
- **Driver Assignment:** Automates assignment of orders to drivers based on location, availability, and load.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Generates reports on delivery metrics, including success rates, delays, and route efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js / Vue.js (specify actual framework)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express / Python Flask (specify actual backend)
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL (specify actual database)
- **Mapping:** Google Maps API / Mapbox / OpenStreetMap
